# European Option Pricer 

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of option pricing and structured product simulation. 

## Project Overview

In this Jupyter Notebook, you will find:

- **Black-Scholes Pricing:**  
  Compute the analytical price of European call and put options using the Black-Scholes formula.

- **Greeks Calculation:**  
  Calculate key sensitivities such as Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho for a given option.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:**  
  Price European options numerically by simulating the underlying asset's distribution.

- **Exotic Option – Digital Option Pricing:**  
  Demonstrate both the closed-form solution and a Monte Carlo approach for pricing a digital (binary) option.

- **Structured Product – Autocallable Option Simulation:**  
  Simulate an autocallable structured product that can be called early based on preset conditions.

- **Sensitivity Analysis:**  
  Analyze how the option price varies with volatility.

## Future upgrades

- **Extended Sensitivity Analysis:**
Explore additional sensitivities such as vanna, vomma, and second-order Greeks.

- **Interest Rate Dynamics:**
Integrate models that account for stochastic interest rates.

- **Portfolio Simulations:**
Simulate a portfolio of options or structured products to study diversification and risk management.
